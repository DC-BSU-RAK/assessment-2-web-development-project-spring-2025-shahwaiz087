            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Green Valley Secondary School was established in 2010 with a vision to provide quality education that combines academic excellence with Islamic values and moral development. Located in the heart of Lahore, we have been serving the educational needs of our community for over 15 years.</p>
            
            <p>Our school started with just 50 students and 8 teachers in a small building. Today, we proudly serve over 850 students with a dedicated team of 45 qualified teachers and staff members. This growth reflects our commitment to educational excellence and the trust our community has placed in us.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Our Mission:</strong> To nurture well-rounded individuals who excel academically, embrace Islamic values, and contribute positively to society through quality education and character development.

            <h2>What Makes Us Special</h2>
            <p>We believe education is more than just textbooks and exams. Our approach focuses on developing the whole child - academically, morally, and socially. We integrate modern teaching methods with traditional Islamic values to prepare students for success in this world and the hereafter.</p>

            <p>Our experienced teachers use interactive teaching methods, practical learning experiences, and technology to make education engaging and effective. We maintain small class sizes to ensure every student receives individual attention and support.</p>
